# Pathfinding-and-terrain-generation


Script generating heightmap using diamond-square (DSA) algorithm and finding
shortest path between two endpoints using Dijkstra's algorithm (DA).

Script was written as an exercise in path finding algorithms in summer 2016.

To do list:
- Replacing unvisited set with deque weighted with distance
  Look Python Cookbook chapter 1.5
- Introduce A* algorithm as an alternative and compare their effectiveness
- Introduce different map generation algorithms
- Introduce proper planet surface generation (erosion, tectonic plates?)
